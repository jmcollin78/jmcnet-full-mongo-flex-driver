Installation is very easy. Just download the last driver swc file ([here](http://code.google.com/p/jmcnet-full-mongo-flex-driver/downloads/list) and the _JMCNet Commons Library_ swc [here](http://code.google.com/p/jmcnet/downloads/list)).

Make your build path points to these swc files, and you are ready to use !
